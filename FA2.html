					<h5>From the barong to the terno, these brands are rewriting tradition with fresh silhouettes, unexpected pairings, and unapologetic flair</h5>
					<h2><b>Filipino ensembles, recut and reborn</b></h2>
					<h4>By:  Tamanna Mahbubani</h4>
					<h4>Published: October 29, 2025 | 12:45 pm</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: normal;">Filipino fashion is in the midst of a quiet renaissance. It’s a new sartorial period that does not erase the past, but reinterprets it. 
						<br>
						<br>From traditional silhouettes updated with contemporary tailoring to local textiles refashioned for the global stage, designers are rewriting the language of Filipino style. 
						<br>
						<br>In a world where heritage and modernity often clash, these four brands prove they can coexist beautifully. 
						<br>
						<br><b>HaMu</b>
						<br>Experimental elegance, woven in culture
						<br>
						<br>Avant-garde, maximalist, fashion as performance
						<br>
						<br><b>Studio Süg</b>
						<br>Where streetwear meets Southern roots
						<br>
						<br>Founded by stylist Bea Constantino, Studio Süg partners with weaving communities across the Visayas and Mindanao to create streetwear literally laced with cultural integrity. 
						<br>
						<br>Cropped jackets in t’nalak, patchworked trousers in abel, and utilitarian tote bags all carry the fingerprint of Southern Filipino pride. This brand is for the fashion kid who is as into provenance as they are proportions.
						<br>
						<br>This is not cultural appropriation, but cultural participation.
						<br>
						<br><b>Áraw </b>
						<br>Slow linen fashion meets sun-washed heritage
						<br>
						<br>Rooted in mindfulness and movement, Áraw offers a breezy, modern take on Filipino identity. 
						<br>
						<br>Their linen sets, relaxed barongs, and reimagined Filipinianas are designed to be lived in, in a way that is effortless yet intentional.
						<br>
						<br>Each piece is made locally in small batches, with sustainability and subtle storytelling woven into every seam. 
						<br>
						<br>Whether you are layering a terno-sleeved kimono over denim or slipping into a barong-inspired tunic on a summer day, Áraw brings heritage into the now with ease and grace.
						<br>
						<br>Filipino culture, distilled into the everyday
						<br>
						<br><b>Halo Halo </b>
						<br>Handwoven, reimagined
						<br>
						<br>Halohalo turns everyday Filipino materials into objects of cult cool. Known for their structured bags crafted from recycled plastic, handwoven banig, and industrial mesh, the brand fuses function with fashion. 
						<br>
						<br>Playfully referencing palengke totes, jeepney signage, and childhood textures, their boxy silhouettes and color-blocked palettes rework the humble carry-all with an “it-bag” status. It is hyperlocal, hyperpractical, and unmistakably modern.
						<br>
						<br>Built for today, but rooted in memory.
						<br>
						<br><b>Cariñosa</b>
						<br>Femme, flirty, Filipiniana for your feet
						<br>
						<br>Cariñosa crafts modern footwear that pays homage to classic silhouettes and textiles. From lace-up heels with jusi panels to sandals embroidered like your grandfather’s barong, the label turns nostalgia into something you can walk in. 
						<br>
						<br>Founded by Rosanna Periquet and Nina Magbanua, their pieces carry the energy of a debutante who now runs her own design studio.
						<br>
						<br>Not your lola’s heels—but she would definitely want a pair
						<br>
						<br>With these brands, modern Filipino fashion does not shy away from heritage. Instead, it slips it on, styles it, and wears it loud.
						<br>
