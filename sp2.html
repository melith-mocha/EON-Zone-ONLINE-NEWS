					<h2><b>Eman Bacosa, Manny Pacquiao’s son, stays undefeated in Thrilla card</b></h2>
					<h4>By: Mark Giongco - Deputy Online Sports Editor | Published October 29, 2025  04:49 PM</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: normal;"> MANILA, Philippines–Lightweight prospect Eman Bacosa kept his record unblemished in the undercard of “Thrilla in Manila 2” on Wednesday at Araneta Coliseum.
						<br>
						<br>The new ranking was released on Monday, just as she begins her campaign in the Hong Kong Open, marking her final push in this year’s WTA season.
						<br>
						<br>The 21-year-old Bacosa, a fan favorite, hiked his record to 7-0 with four knockouts.
						<br>
						<br>Bacosa has unenviably big shoes to fill, carrying the name of his famous father, who is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time.
						<br>
						<br>Living up to the eight-division champion’s legacy, however, is not something he’s paying attention to this early in his career.
						<br>
						<br>“I’m just focused on myself and my fight,” said Bacosa, who started boxing when he was 10 years old, on Tuesday.
						<br>
						<br>Melvin Jerusalem risks his WBC minimumweight title against South Africa’s Siyakholwa Kuse in the main event.</p>
