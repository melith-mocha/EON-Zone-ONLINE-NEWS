					<h2><b>Sony Music artists bag most wins at 1st Filipino Music Awards</b></h2>
					<h4>By:  Jan Milo Severo - Philstar.com</h4>

						<p style="font-weight: normal;">MANILA, Philippines — Sony Music Philippines artists emerged as the most-awarded acts at the first-ever Filipino Music Awards (FMA), collectively winning nine major titles.
						<br>
						<br>Leading the charge was global pop phenomenon SB19, who swept a total of six awards, among them Tour of the Year, Concert of the Year, and the much-coveted Artist of the Year.
						<br>
						<br>The acclaimed Filipino boyband also clinched two People’s Choice Awards for Artist and Song, and another one for Pop Song of the Year for their chart-topping single “Dungka!” from their latest EP, "Simula At Wakas."
						<br>
						<br>Another standout from the Sony Music roster, IV of Spades, made a triumphant return to the spotlight, earning Rock Song of the Year for their hit single “Aura.” A few months ago, the track debuted at No. 4 on the Spotify Philippines Top 50 chart, marking a celebrated comeback for the band.
						<br>
						<br>Their upcoming headline concert at the SM Mall of Asia Arena, produced by Karpos, sold out two months in advance.
						<br>
						<br>Rising Bicol-born singer-songwriter Dwta also brought home honors for “Folk Song of the Year” with “Sampung Mga Daliri,” her collaborative track with SB19’s Justin. Apart from this song, Dwta was also part of the official soundtrack of Fatrick Tabada’s "Flower Girl" and co-writing credits on BINI’s viral hit “First Luv.”
						<br>
						<br>The record label also bagged the prestigious Music Company of the Year.
						<br>
						<br>“We’re deeply honored and proud of our artists whose stellar work has been recognized in a prestigious award-giving body like Filipino Music Awards,” said Kevin Foo, managing director – Southeast Asia, Sony Music Entertainment.
						<br>
						<br>“Through this recognition, we remain committed in empowering Filipino musicians and showcasing the diversity and global potential of OPM as a music movement," he added. 
						<br>
						<br>Beyond the recognition, several Filipino artists lit up the FMA stage with performances featuring songs from the Sony Music Entertainment catalog. IV of Spades delivered “Aura,” Ely Buendia performed “Kandarapa,” and Gloc-9 captivated the audience with “Upuan.”
						<br>
						<br>The evening reached its peak with monumental finale featuring SB19 and Ben& Ben. SB19 energized the stage with “DAM,” followed by Ben&Ben’s moving performance of “Kapangyarihan.”
						<br>
						<br>The moment was made even more special as it marked the first-ever public performance of “Kapangyarihan” featuring both Ben&Ben and SB19 together, closing the night on a high and emotional note.
